# chatgpt-assist-home
(WIP) This project makes ChatGPT able to control your home at the command of your voice. Being a procedural language model, ChatGPT is capable of communicating with you and understanding your requests, as well as being able to converse with you throughout the day. I would want able to integrate this into a device like Alexa, or Google Home (using Raspeaker for example)
