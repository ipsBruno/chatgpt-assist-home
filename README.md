(MVP)

This project uses the Tuya Cloud API and the ChatGPT-4 API to turn devices on and off by understanding human natural language. This makes commands more user-friendly and easier to understand. You can, for instance, command it to turn off all the lights, just the bedroom lights, or turn off the bedroom lights and turn on the living room lights. The system will interpret the commands via ChatGPT and connect to Tuya to perform the necessary actions.
